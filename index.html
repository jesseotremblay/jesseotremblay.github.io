									<h2>Starting Over</h2>
									<p>Lego were my favorite toy as growing up. I would get Lego sets, build them to the direction spec. Then I would rip it all apart and build something entirely new and different with existing pieces from other sets. This was partly done out of curiosity for what I could make given the things I had. However, it was also done because I was always dissatisfied with something as soon as it was built. I wanted more</p>
									<p>This blog, or my blogs in general, is no different. I can't even tell you how many iterations of my personal blog I have gone through. Every time, completely dissatisfied with what had been written. Every time, taken down with the inevitability of being replaced</p>
									<p>This is another effort to start and maintain a thoughtful catalogue of my triumphs, failures and thoughts. I'm not sure where this will go, but I can assure myself that I will always be dissatisfied with it, and that is what drives me forward to constantly learn from my past, and correct for the future.</p>

								<h1>Reviver Tool</h1>
								<h2>Hypothesis</h2>

									<h3>Users:</h3>

									<ul>
									<li>Salesforce Admins</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Problems:</h3>

									<p>Currently, admins need to go through each lead individually, which takes time. This can also result in lost leads and lost revenue</p>

									<h3>Solution:</h3>

									<p>Create a simple and elegant solution to help admins batch allocate lost leads with a single interaction. A tool that helps them quickly identify which leads have been lost and gives them a way to easily assign them to other accounts.</p>

									<h3>Assumptions:</h3>

									<ul>
									<li>Desktop first - Salesforce Admins are likely to use this service on a work desktop machine.</li>
									<li>Admins need to quickly be able to identify and assign leads.</li>
									<li>Security must be conveyed as important company files will be used.</li>
									<li>Likely a one-time use, not an every day tool</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Method to Validate:</h3>

									<p>Testing with Salesforce Admins to find out their pain-points and understanding their needs.</p>

									<h3>Minimum Success Criteria</h3>

									<p>Salesforce admin must be able to quickly oAuth into their Salesforce account and receive their list of unassigned leads. There also must be a way to access their accounts as to be able to quickly assign each lead to the preexisting accounts.</p>

								<p>After some deep user research a simple and intuitive tool was sketched out to help identify the core components and interactions. From here I began to make Hi-fi mockups.</p>

							<h1>Gamifynd</h1>
							<h2>Hypothesis</h2>

								<h3>Users:</h3>

								<ul>
								<li>Ex-pat Soccer fan</li>
								<li>Domestic, European soccer fans</li>

								<h4>Secondary</h4>
								<li>Bars</li>
								<li>Supporters Groups</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Problems:</h3>

								<ul>
								<li>Finding places to watch games with friends and/or people of similar team/league taste can be difficult. Unless a fan already knows, or knows people, it is hard to discover where to watch games with other similar fans.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Solution:</h3>

								<ul>
								<li>Platform for discovering games, local supporters groups and other friends and fans of similar teams and leagues. Also, finding bars which are playing games and meetup events.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Assumptions:</h3>

								<ul>
								<li>Mobile First - Users are likely on the go and looking to find somehting around them</li>
								<li>Can&#8217;t do it all in mobile, but a majority of information users will want to access on mobile</li>
								<li>Users want to be able to add friends and groups</li>
								<li>Bars may want to create their own pages</li>
								<li>Groups may want their own pages</li>
								<li>Finding places to watch games is hard because of gap in discoverability</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Method to Validate:</h3>

								<ul>
								<li>Test ability to find information and features that USERS care most about</li>
								<li>Test ability to find information and features that GROUPS care most about</li>
								<li>Test ability to find information and features that BARS care most about</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Minimum Success Criteria</h3>

								<ul>
								<li>User is about to find without guidance:

								<ul>
								<li>Favorite team</li>
								<li>Next Games</li>
								<li>Groups</li>
								<li>Bars</li>
								<li>Schedule</li>
								<li>Search</li>

							<h1>Quotable</h1>
							<h4>Project Overview</h4>
							<p>A freind of mine and I started working on a simple app that would let people store quotes they hear in the world. Notebook software seemed far too utilitarian to add something like quotes to. So, we released a test version of the app on the web and the app store. <a href="http://quotableapp.io">Go here</a> to check it out.</p>
							<p>After a few months in the store, and after talking to people who used it, we found that our idea was validated. People were actually using it, and found it very useful. So, we decided to talk with them to see what could be improved. This redesign below is the result of those conversations.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<img src="images/quotable/entry_screen.png" class="screenz"/>
							<img src="images/quotable/sign_up.png" class="screenz"/>
							<img src="images/quotable/pick_username.png" class="screenz"/>
							<br>
							<p>First, we revamped the signup flow to make it easier to create profiles. We even tested the idea of not having users create an account, but the ability to save quotes, especially on the web, proved to be impossible without an account to attach them to. The username helped people identify and associate quotes with their friends in a way that email couldn't, due to users not remembering friends email.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<img src="images/quotable/choose_date.png" class="screenz"/>
							<img src="images/quotable/choose_friend.png" class="screenz"/>
							<img src="images/quotable/done_quote.png" class="screenz"/>
							<br>
							<p>Next, we added some options for the users to associate tags, dates, locations and friends. Users were interested in quick ways to find old quotes quickly, and these were the 4 ways that proved to be the most useful and intuitive for them.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<img src="images/quotable/quote_list.png" class="screenz"/>
							<br>
							<p>Now, we are working on ways to add integration and sharing features for users. Mothers have asked for ways to share pictures of their kids with family. Email sharing will help families connect these moments together. Friends are looking for ways to share their quotes to the world on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>
							<p>These designs and feautures are currently being prototyped and tested. Look out for the new Quotable to be coming soon!</p>
