	<p>Hi, my name is Jesse. I'm a 33 year old former small business owner and marketing consultant. I've been designing graphics and web pages as a hobby since the Dawson's Creek cast were still in high school. After a long journey through manufacturing, professional soccer coaching, business ownership and eventually consulting, I've decided to pursue my real career passion, web design. Thanks for checking out my page!</p>
